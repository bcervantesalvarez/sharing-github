Learning Python...
The repositories that shared are for learning purposes. If the original creator is unhappy that I am sharing this, I will take this down immediately.
However, following their advice I am showing it here for the reason of building a habit for sharing my projects.
Until I build projects by myself, I will post my progress through the IBM course.
